                <h2>Ayasofya</h2>
                <p>
                    Hagia Sophia, also known as Hagia Sophia, is a historical architectural marvel located in Istanbul, Turkey. Originally built as a cathedral in the 6th century during the Byzantine Empire, it served as the principal church of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) for nearly 1,000 years. Emperor Justinian I commissioned the construction of Hagia Sophia and the building was completed in 537 AD. The building is famous for its massive dome, intricate mosaics and innovative architectural design. For centuries it remained the largest cathedral in the world. In 1453, after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque by Sultan Mehmed II. It served as a mosque for about 500 years under Ottoman rule. During this time, various changes were made to the original structure, including the addition of minarets. In 1935, under the leadership of the Republic of Turkey and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Hagia Sophia was organised and converted into a museum as part of efforts to modernise the country. The conversion was intended to emphasise the cultural and historical aspects of the monument. In July 2020, the Turkish government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, decided to convert Hagia Sophia back into a mosque, sparking international controversy. The decision was met with mixed reactions, with some celebrating it as a return to Islamic heritage, while others expressed concern about the impact on the historical and cultural significance of the site. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hagia Sophia has played an important role in both Christian and Islamic history. Its architectural and cultural significance continues to attract visitors from around the world.                </p>
